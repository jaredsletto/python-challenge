Module 3 Challenge

In this challenge we learned Python and the Git Command Line.

The code runs error free and prints to a txt file. 

I did not know if the graders would prefer the code to print to the terminal in addition to the txt file. I did not want to assume the preferance, so I left the print statements in the code.
